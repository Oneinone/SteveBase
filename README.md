# SteveBase

A broken and WIP CSGO cheat base I written a year ago. It hasn't been touched for 3 months and will not work on latest game.

Most of the functionalities are not implemented, because I'm too lazy and are abandoning game cheating to pursue compiler design, plus some implmentations are deleted, so at most this is a right out alternative for [MarkHC/CSGOSimple](https://github.com/MarkHC/CSGOSimple) ðŸ˜‡

This cheat uses some cutting edge language infrastruture so the latest version of MSVC is required.

# Build

Just open up `SteveBase.sln` and start the build process. If it doesn't work for you, consider it as an antipaste tatic.

# Requirement
- [VS2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
  - C++17 + TS Coroutine
  - Windows XP support
- Windows SDK
- DirectX SDK
- [VC-LTL](https://github.com/Chuyu-Team/VC-LTL)
  - Smaller binary
- (Optional) Boost
- (Optional) Resharper
  - This base is a little bit bloated and should better be managed by IDE tools

# What's missing
- Aimbot
  - Antiaim
  - Spinbot
  - Resolvers
- ESP
  - Player
  - Weapon
  - Chams
- CVar spoofing
- Skin changer
- UI design
- Comments and annotations, etc...

However, all the required files to implement almost all such functionalies, are included out of the box.
